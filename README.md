# fakenewsdetectioN
Fake News Detection final year project using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.
This project has been implemented using Python.

The frontend part is made using HTML and Flask.

The flask page displays whether the news is REAL OR FAKE when the user inputs text from the dataset used.

In the project, machine learning algorithms are compared- logistic regression and decision tree algorithm.
In the current era of rapidly burgeoning technology, news of every region whether it be social, commercial, or political kinds have been arising. Every statement, announcement, magazine, journal, and report comes into being reaching millions online. The spread of incorrect information can potentially cause chaos in society. To avoid such social issues created by deceptive content online, our proposed project idea comes to light. 
Our cogent projectâ€™s idea is to decipher the degree of the fakeness of the news by using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. These get categorized as important applications of artificial intelligence. We use different ML algorithms and methodologies for detecting fake news articles, with reference to our respective data sets displaying the corresponding performance and result. Valid news dataset has been taken from the Kaggle site which is one of the most sought-after websites for getting datasets by data scientists. In our proposed method, we use pre-process the data and display it in wordcloud form. Therefore the model training, evaluation, and correctness of the piece of news taken from the corresponding data set has been done. we have also made a simple Flask web page where the type of news is displayed after the user enters the news segment. Our future goal is to make the model more open to bigger data sets since tons of data flows in each day with time and work on making the web page better.
